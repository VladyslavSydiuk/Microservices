# Microservices Project

## Microservices Included
The project consists of the following services:
- **Authorization Service** â€“ Handles authentication and user registration.
- **Client Service** â€“ Provides user-related functionalities.
- **Service Registry** â€“ Manages service discovery and registration (Eureka or similar).

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** â€“ Framework for building microservices.
- **Spring Boot Authorization Server** â€“ Implements OAuth2 authentication.
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization for easy deployment.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and run the project locally using **Docker Compose**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VladyslavSydiuk/Microservices.git
   cd Microservices
   ```
2. Run the services using Docker Compose:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. The services should now be accessible.
